This repository contains documentation, and applications for receiving, demodulating, and decoding the UHF signal transmitted by the ESA OPS-SAT mission. It also contains a full graphical application for viewing and parsing the beacon frames transmitted by OPS-SAT.

## Overview

### UHF specifications
Can be found in docs/os-uhf-specs.pdf

### Applications

Authors: Guilhem Honore, Maxence Beuselinck, Tim Oerther

The project has been taken over to be wrapped as an AppImage and the dependencies updated. You can find the releases for x86_64 and aarch64.
To build it yourself, you can set as executable and run the script [build_appimage.sh](./app-builder_script/build_appimage.sh).
The goal of the AppImage is to have a working out-of-the-box project for all amateur radio operator.

## Getting started

Please download the appropriate [AppImage](https://github.com/esa/gr-opssat/releases), run the AppImage with
```
chmod +x opssat_uhf-$ARCH.AppImage #set the AppImage as exectuable
./opssat_uhf-$ARCH.AppImage
```

## Operational usage with live reception
For operational usage, please look at the [UHF campain guide](docs/UHF_Campain_GUIDE.md)

## Desktop interface

It receives the RS decoded CSP packet + 4 byte CRC32-C over a ZMQ socket on localhost port 38211 to which it is subscribed.
You should now see beacon frames being parsed and displayed:

The raw packet history shows the received packets, CRC check status and CSP header information.

This application writes to 3 logfiles in a temporary folder located in `/tmp/` or your linux machine:
* One log contains the raw received hex data (raw.log)
* The second log contains the parsed beacon telemetry (parsed_beacon.log)
* The third log contains timestamped events generated by the application (gui_event.log)
